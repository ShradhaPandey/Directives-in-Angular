# Directives-in-Angular
Structural directives: which change the structure of the dom
*ngIf and *ngFOr
Note: we cannot use more than 1 structural directive on the same dom element.

Attribute directives:
ngClass and ngStyle
ngClass: define a css class in css file and use it on an element when you want to change the styling dynamically.
ngStyle: define a css style, inline way on the element itself and use it on an element when you want to change the styling dynamically.
Since both ngClass and ngStyle directives work only when the given condition is true,
we can chnage the styling dynamically.

Custom directive: we can create our own directives.
